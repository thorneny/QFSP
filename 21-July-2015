<h1>Questions for Smarter People: 21-July-2015</h1>
<p>1/ Question for Smarter People: If bitcoin / the blockchain is a protocol, so we compare it to email/SMTP (among other protocols)... How likely is it that business opportunities will develop and emerge along an analagous course: For example, do bitcoin wallets equate to inboxes? So baseline wallets are like Gmail et al. > Primarily infrastructure-layer products given away and monetized through adjacent products (in inbox's case: advertising). But rich clients that expand on very specific uses of email (/ the protocol) are potentially big businesses that people pay a lot for: See RelateIQ for salespeople, Desk.com for customer service, just to name two that come to mind.</p>
